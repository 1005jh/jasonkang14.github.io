I have been told that terminology—knowing exact words to use in different situations—is important at <a href=\"https://wecode.co.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WeCode</a>, but didn’t fully understand it until I went through interviews. Below are some examples written in no speicic order, just based off what I recall.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>populate</li>\n<li>to add record to a database. It can be data for testing an application’s functionality or the actual data during implementation.</li>\n<li>sanitize</li>\n<li>to remove malicious data from user input, such as form submissions</li>\n<li>to clean user input to avoid code-conflicts (duplicate ids for instance), security issues (xss codes etc), or other issues that might arise from non-standardized input &#x26; human error/deviance.</li>\n<li>stale</li>\n<li>old data that is no longer fresh. something that has not been updated to represent current information</li>\n<li>pure</li>\n<li>of which return value is only determined by its input values, without observable side effects.</li>\n<li>side effect</li>\n<li>the modification of some kind of state outside its local environment something like a mutable data structure or variable, using IO, throwing an exception or halts an erro</li>\n<li>does not have to be hidden or unexpected, and I was told that sometime side effects are used on purpose in order to implement certain things of which examples that I do not recall</li>\n<li>declarative</li>\n<li>a programming paradigm in which the programmer defines what needs to be accomplished by the program without defining how it needs to be implemented.</li>\n<li>imperative</li>\n<li>opposite of declarative. you have to define how it needs to be implemented.</li>\n<li>memoize</li>\n<li>caching information to return the output when a program receives an input that it has experienced</li>\n<li>stateless</li>\n<li>no record of previous interactions and each interaction request has to be handled based entirely on information that comes with it.</li>\n<li>opposite of stateful, which keeps the records of previous interactions</li>\n<li>RESTful: Definition from <a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">RESTFULAPI.net</a></li>\n<li>Representational State Transfer</li>\n<li>\n<p>Characteristics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stateless: as described above, each request from client to server must contain all the necessary information to understand the request as no information from previous requests is stored</li>\n<li>cacheable: data within a response to a request must be labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If cacheable, a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later</li>\n<li>Uniform interface: four interface constraints:</li>\n<li>identification of resources</li>\n<li>manipulation of resources through representations</li>\n<li>self-descriptive messages</li>\n<li>hypermedia as the engine of application state</li>\n<li>to be honest, I have no idea what the fourth constraint means</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>compile</li>\n<li>the process of creating an executable program from code written in a compiled programming language</li>\n<li>allows a computer to run and understand a program without the need of the programming software used to create the program</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/Terminology-from-Interviews","tagSlugs":["/tag/javascript/","/tag/programming/","/tag/python/","/tag/django/","/tag/terminology/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-08-09T23:27:37.121Z","description":"Some important terminology in web development based on interview questions","tags":["javascript","programming","python","django","terminology"],"title":"Terminology from Interviews"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/Terminology-from-Interviews"}}}
