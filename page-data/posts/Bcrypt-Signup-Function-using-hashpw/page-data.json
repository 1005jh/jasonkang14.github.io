And signup was also fairly easy.</p>\n<p>First, install bcrypt:\n<code class=\"language-text\">pip install bcrypt</code></p>\n<p>And using bcrypt, you gotta encode the entered password into <code class=\"language-text\">bytes</code> type,and then hash the password using a salt.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">else :\n    password = bytes(new_account_info[&quot;password&quot;], &quot;utf-8&quot;)\n    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())\n\n    new_account = Account(\n        user_id = new_account_info[&quot;user_id&quot;],\n        password = hashed.decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;),\n    )\n\n    new_account.save()</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can use a randomly generated salt using <code class=\"language-text\">bcrypt.gensalt()</code>, which gets added to the password entered by the user. Then it gets hashed by using <code class=\"language-text\">bcrypt.hashpw()</code>, which gets decoded again before getting saved to the database.</p>\n<p>I saved the decoded password to the databse, which doesn’t really seem to make sense becuase the database probably should have encoded password, which sounds more secure. However, if I save encoded password to the database, it causes problem when the server checks the password upon login,which will be discussed in the next post.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/Bcrypt-Signup-Function-using-hashpw","tagSlugs":["/tag/bcrypt/","/tag/python/","/tag/django/","/tag/hasing/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-07-02T21:27:37.121Z","description":"Implementing Signup using Django and Bcrypt","tags":["bcrypt","python","django","hasing"],"title":"Bcrypt[hashpw()] Signup, how to hash password securely"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/Bcrypt-Signup-Function-using-hashpw"}}}
