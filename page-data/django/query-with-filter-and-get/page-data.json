It something like this</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">User.objects.filter(join_date__year=2020)</code></p>\n<p>This query will give you all the users who has signed up for your server in the year of 2020. Your query is supposed to look like below;</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">User.objects.all().filter(join_date__year=2020)</code></p>\n<p>However, your <strong>Manager</strong> class allows your query to be shorter</p>\n<p>You can also add a condition to <code class=\"language-text\">exclude</code> certain data like below;</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">User.objects.filter(join_date__year=2020).exclude(join_date__month=5)</code></p>\n<p>By using this, you are excluding all the users who have signed up in May.</p>\n<p>There are some methods that you can find in the django official doc. In case of filtering by number, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">count__gte=30</code>, which is equivalent to count greater than 30, and also <code class=\"language-text\">count__lte=30</code>, which would be coult less than 30.</p>\n<p>In the case of filtering by string, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">headline__startswith=&quot;what&quot;</code>, which is straight forward, and I believe there is also <code class=\"language-text\">headline__endswith=&quot;what&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>And you would use <code class=\"language-text\">get</code> when you expect to receive only one query set. For example, if you added <code class=\"language-text\">unique=True</code> to an email field, you would query your user like this;</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">User.objects.get(email=&#39;test@email.com&#39;)</code></p>","fields":{"slug":"/django/query-with-filter-and-get","tagSlugs":["/tag/django/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-25T19:53:37.121Z","description":"How to make a query in Django using filter abd get","tags":["django"],"title":"Django - Query with Filter and Get"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/django/query-with-filter-and-get"}}}
