### Synchronous vs Asynchronous

1. In synchronous programming, things happen one at a time. If there is a function that takes a while to finish, nothing will happen until that function is finished running.

2. In asynchronous programming, a lot of things happen at the same time. Even if there is a function that takes a while to finish, the program continues to run.
