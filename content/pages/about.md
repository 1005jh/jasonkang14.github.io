I graduated from University of Illinois with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. <br>
After working as a process engineer at a refinery in South Korea, I decided to pivot my career to web development. <br><br>
In June 2019, I joined WeCode, which is a coding bootcamp based in Seoul, South Korea. I will be acquiring necessary skill sets to work as a web developer after three months. <br><br>
Check out my blog to see what I have learned and what I am capable of. <br> Feel free to reach out if you would like to get to know more about me or discuss possible opportunities.
